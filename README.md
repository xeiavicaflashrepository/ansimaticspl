# ansimaticspl
A very crude perl script for printing ANSI escape sequences to the terminal for art and animation purposes.  
I like doing things very frame by frame with animation, so I whipped together this crude quick and dirty perl script. It's nothing impressive, but I really had to store this somewhere so I won't have to write it again.
